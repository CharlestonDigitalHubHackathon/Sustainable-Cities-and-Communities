# Sustainable Cities and Communities

> Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
>
> Cities are hubs for ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, social development and much more. At their best, cities have enabled people to advance socially and economically. With the number of people living within cities projected to rise to 5 billion people by 2030, itâ€™s important that efficient urban planning and management practices are in place to deal with the challenges brought by urbanization.

## Dataset Summary
Hazardous air pollutants, also known as toxic air pollutants or air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks 187 air pollutants.

The daily summary file contains data for every monitor (sampled parameter) in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database for each day. This file will contain a daily summary record that is: 1. The aggregate of all sub-daily measurements taken at the monitor. 2. The single sample value if the monitor takes a single, daily sample (e.g., there is only one sample with a 24-hour duration). In this case, the mean and max daily sample will have the same value.

## Dataset Download

We will upload the dataset to be used during the challenge on Friday, February 22nd.
